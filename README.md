## Instruction

If you run into troubles with clicking, please check your Übersicht settings.

The interface is MULTI-LANGUAGE! So don't worry if you don't speak German. Supported languages:

* Deutsch
* English

## Click to update!
You can update Evangelion Übersicht Widget (version >= 0.X8a) simply by clicking the update button. Not that there will be frequent updates, but it saves time. I'll try out some ways to make updating even cooler, given time that is.

## Memory Usage VS Memory Pressure
As of version 0.X11a, the memory cell will show memory pressure levels (NORMAL, WARN, CRITICAL) rather than the memory usage percentage. The reason behind this move is simple: **memory usage percentage makes little sense in OSX now.**

**To explain:** A few years ago, OSX implemented a new virtual memory technology called memory compression (OK it's actually rather ancient, but people stopped using it as memory got much cheaper back in the 90s). Imagine you have a lot of stuff taking up memory, but you cannot tell exactly how much because you do not know how many of them are compressed. Therefore, memory usage percentage no longer matters as much as it looks like. Instead, we use memory pressure levels, which shows the degree to which the performance is slowed down by memory usage. OSX defines 3 levels: **NORMAL**, **WARN**, **CRITICAL**:

*  **NORMAL:** Everything is fine. No performance issue!
*  **WARN:** There might be noticeable drop in performance. The user is advised to clean up the memory (or upgrade the RAM).
*  **CRITICAL:** The computer will likely freeze up, and the user should terminate some certain processes.

In short, take actions when the memory cell turns red!

## Major Update Notice!
Please consider updating if you are still using widget earlier than 0.X2a. The newer version has greatly alleviated the performance issues. Now it uses only 10% of energy and 20% of CPU compared to the previous versions.

## About
This widget is an Evangelion Übersicht Widget, displaying information through a huge amount of cells on your desktop.

If you leaves nothing on your desktop except for less than six mounted volumes (system volumes, connected servers etc.), this widget can replace your desktop completely.

### Currently the widget could show:

1. Time
2. CPU and memory usage (memory pressure)
3. Battery status
4. Trash size
5. Your public ip address
6. Artist, title and Album over of what currently being played on iTunes. (You can also control iTunes!)
7. First 5 of all your mounted volumes in alphabetical order
8. Network traffic
9. Alert on DoNotDisturb mode
10. Vocal notice on alerts. Default is OFF, turn it on by setting config.Voice to true.

### Special features
* Update button displayed when new version is released.
* Alarm system, triggers when CPU usage is too high or battery drops to below 20% without charging
* Empty your trash bin by clicking the trash cell
* Open up a volume by clicking it
